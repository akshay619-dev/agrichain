### Project Name : Agrichain Assignment

### Overview

Implement the code for a supermarket checkout process that calculates the total
price of items added in the cart by the customer. In our store, weâ€™ll use individual
letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on) to represent items. Products can be
purchased at their individual pricing or at a discounted price when purchased in
groups as listed below: For example, item â€˜Aâ€™ might cost 50 cents individually, but
this week we have a special offer: buy three â€˜Aâ€™s and theyâ€™ll cost you $1.30. Product
pricing for this week is as below:
         
| Item   | Unit Price    | Special Price   |
| ------ |:-------------:| ---------------:|
| A      | 50            | 3 for 130       |
| B      | 30            | 2 for 45        |
| C      | 20            |                 |
| D      | 15            |                 |


Our checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan product B, then product
A, and then another product B, weâ€™ll recognize the two Bâ€™s and price them at a
discounted price of Rs 45 instead of individual pricing of Rs 30, which brings the
Total order pricing to Rs 95.

Expected output are as follows:

Examples:

| INPUT  | OUTPUT        |
| ------ |:-------------:|
| ""     | 0             |
| "A"    | 50            |
| "AB"   | 80            |
| "CDBA" | 115           |


Guidelines for implementing this challenge : 
1. Use Python3 to solve the problem.
2. Apply OOPs principles
3. Add Readme on how to run/setup
4. Added Bonus - Tests and dockerisation.

### Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose installed locally
Node.js and npm (for frontend development)

### Backend Setup

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/akshay619-dev/agrichain.git
cd agrichain
```

Build and run the Docker container:

```shell
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### OR Setup Manually

```shell
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the application 
```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

### Access the backend API at http://localhost:8000.

### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```shell
cd ../frontend
```
## Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```
## Run Frontend as dev environemt

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Access the frontend at http://localhost:5173.

## Build the frontend application:

```shell
npm run build
```
